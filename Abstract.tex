This Thesis describes the Y(nS) analysis in PbPb , pPb and pp collisions recorded by CMS during different runs.
The present work studies thouroughly the suppression of the excited 2S and 3S states in PbPb collisions, relative to the ground 1S state and to the pp control dataset. For the entire phase space accessible, given by $\mid y\mid <2.0$, $p_{\rm{T}}<50$ GeV/c, 0-100\% centrality, we measure the double ratio Y(2S+3S)/Y(1S) in PbPb relative to pp collisions to be $\chi=xx$. The relative suppression is further observed to increase with centrality. For the most central collisions, 0-30\%, we measure $\chi=xx$, with a significance of over $5\,\sigma$ (p-value $xx$). No noticeable dependence of $\chi$ on $p_{\rm{T}}$ or rapidity is observed. The differential production cross-sections of the ground Y(1S) and excited Y(2S+3S) states are also measured, as a function of the dimuon transverse momentum and collision centrality. The observed Y(1S) suppression is found to be consistent with the reduced feeddown from the suppressed excited Y states.
